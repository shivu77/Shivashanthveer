## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides legal advice based on scraped Indian lawyer opinions. The system uses LLMs combined with a vector database to ground responses in actual legal opinions, reducing hallucinations and providing more accurate legal information.

## Key Features

### Data Collection Pipeline
- **Web Scraping**: Custom scraper to collect lawyer opinions from legal websites
- **Data Cleaning**: Robust preprocessing pipeline to clean and normalize legal text
- **Dataset Creation**: Structured dataset of Indian lawyer opinions

### RAG Implementation
- **Vector Store**: FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Embeddings**: High-quality embeddings for legal documents
- **LangChain Integration**: Seamless integration with LangChain for RAG pipeline
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Tuned prompts and retrieval strategies to minimize inaccurate information

### Backend API
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async API
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Clean API design for chatbot interactions
- **Deployment**: Production-ready deployment configuration

## Technical Details

The system uses a two-stage approach:
1. **Retrieval**: Query the vector store to find relevant lawyer opinions
2. **Generation**: Use an LLM to generate responses based on retrieved context

This approach ensures that responses are grounded in actual legal opinions, providing more reliable and accurate information.

## Impact

The chatbot provides a valuable tool for accessing legal information, especially for users who may not have easy access to legal counsel. By grounding responses in actual lawyer opinions, the system provides more trustworthy information than generic LLM responses.
