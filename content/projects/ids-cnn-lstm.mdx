## Overview

This project implements a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for network-based intrusion detection. The model can identify various types of network attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns.

## Architecture

### CNN Component
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses convolutional layers to extract spatial patterns from network traffic data
- **Local Patterns**: Identifies local features in network packets

### LSTM Component
- **Temporal Patterns**: Captures sequential dependencies in network traffic
- **Long-term Memory**: Maintains context over extended sequences
- **Attack Pattern Recognition**: Identifies attack patterns that evolve over time

### Hybrid Approach
The combination of CNN and LSTM allows the model to:
- Extract both spatial and temporal features
- Identify complex attack patterns
- Handle sequential network traffic data effectively

## Dataset

The model was trained on standard network intrusion detection datasets, including:
- Normal network traffic
- Various attack types (DoS, DDoS, Probe, R2L, U2R)

## Results

The hybrid model achieved high accuracy in detecting network intrusions, outperforming single-model approaches. The combination of CNN and LSTM proved effective for this task, as network attacks often exhibit both spatial and temporal patterns.

## Applications

- **Network Security**: Real-time intrusion detection in network environments
- **Threat Detection**: Identifying malicious network activities
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of network traffic
