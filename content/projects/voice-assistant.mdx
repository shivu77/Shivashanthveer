## Overview

A personal voice assistant that combines wake-word detection, custom intent routing, and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. The assistant can be activated with a wake word and responds to custom commands through a flexible intent routing system.

## Features

### Wake-Word Detection
- **Activation**: Custom wake-word recognition for hands-free activation
- **Low Latency**: Fast response to wake-word detection
- **Noise Robustness**: Works in various acoustic environments

### Intent Routing
- **Custom Intents**: Define custom commands and actions
- **Flexible Routing**: Easy-to-extend intent routing system
- **Command Processing**: Natural language understanding for commands

### Text-to-Speech
- **Natural Voice**: High-quality TTS for responses
- **Multiple Voices**: Support for different voice options
- **Response Generation**: Dynamic response generation based on intents

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:
1. **Wake-Word Detector**: Continuously listens for the wake word
2. **Speech Recognizer**: Converts speech to text when activated
3. **Intent Router**: Processes commands and generates appropriate responses
4. **TTS Engine**: Converts responses to speech

## Use Cases

- **Home Automation**: Control smart home devices
- **Personal Tasks**: Set reminders, manage calendar, etc.
- **Information Retrieval**: Answer questions and provide information
- **Custom Applications**: Extensible for various use cases

## Technical Highlights

- Real-time audio processing
- Efficient wake-word detection
- Robust speech recognition
- Natural language understanding
- High-quality text-to-speech synthesis
